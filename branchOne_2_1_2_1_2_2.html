    <h1>
      Taking the offense you end up knocking your friend unconscious. Breathing
      heavily you phone the police on what just occurred. They immediately warn
      you to remain inside and shut the windows or risk constructing a virus
      that makes you violent and paranoid. They assure you help will be sent to
      your house as soon as possible but for now you're safe and alive.
